Synopsis
--------

Join a Hyperledger Fabric peer to a channel by using the IBM Blockchain Platform.

This module works with the IBM Blockchain Platform managed service running in IBM Cloud, or the IBM Blockchain Platform software running in a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.






Parameters
----------

  api_endpoint (optional, str, None)
    The URL for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_authtype (optional, str, None)
    ``ibmcloud`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using IBM Cloud authentication. You must provide a valid API key using *api_key*.

    ``basic`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using basic authentication. You must provide both a valid API key using *api_key* and API secret using *api_secret*.


  api_key (optional, str, None)
    The API key for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_secret (optional, str, None)
    The API secret for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``basic``.


  api_timeout (optional, integer, 60)
    The timeout, in seconds, to use when interacting with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_token_endpoint (optional, str, https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token)
    The IBM Cloud IAM token endpoint to use when using IBM Cloud authentication.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``ibmcloud``, and you are using IBM internal staging servers for testing.


  operation (optional, str, None)
    ``join`` - Join the specified *peer* to the channel with the genesis block specified in *path*.


  peer (optional, raw, None)
    The peer to join to the channel.

    You can pass a string, which is the display name of a peer registered with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    You can also pass a dict, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`peer_info <peer_info_module>` or :ref:`peer <peer_module>` modules.


  identity (optional, raw, None)
    The identity to use when interacting with the peer.

    You can pass a string, which is the path to the JSON file where the enrolled identity is stored.

    You can also pass a dict, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`enrolled_identity_info <enrolled_identity_info_module>` or :ref:`enrolled_identity <enrolled_identity_module>` modules.


  msp_id (optional, str, None)
    The MSP ID to use for interacting with the peer.


  path (optional, str, None)
    The path to the file where the channel genesis block is stored.
