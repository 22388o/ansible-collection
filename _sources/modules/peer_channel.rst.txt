Parameters
----------

  api_endpoint (required)
    The URL for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_authtype (required)
    ``ibmcloud`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using IBM Cloud authentication. You must provide a valid API key using *api_key*.

    ``basic`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using basic authentication. You must provide both a valid API key using *api_key* and API secret using *api_secret*.

    | **Type**: str

  api_key (required)
    The API key for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_secret
    The API secret for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``basic``.

    | **Type**: str

  api_timeout
    The timeout, in seconds, to use when interacting with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: int
    | **Default value**: ``60``

  api_token_endpoint
    The IBM Cloud IAM token endpoint to use when using IBM Cloud authentication.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``ibmcloud``, and you are using IBM internal staging servers for testing.

    | **Type**: str
    | **Default value**: ``https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token``

  operation (required)
    ``join`` - Join the specified *peer* to the channel with the genesis block specified in *path*.

    | **Type**: str

  peer (required)
    The peer to join to the channel.

    You can pass a string, which is the display name of a peer registered with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    You can also pass a dict, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`peer_info <peer_info_module>` or :ref:`peer <peer_module>` modules.

    | **Type**: raw

  identity (required)
    The identity to use when interacting with the peer.

    You can pass a string, which is the path to the JSON file where the enrolled identity is stored.

    You can also pass a dict, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`enrolled_identity_info <enrolled_identity_info_module>` or :ref:`enrolled_identity <enrolled_identity_module>` modules.

    | **Type**: raw

  msp_id (required)
    The MSP ID to use for interacting with the peer.

    | **Type**: str

  hsm
    The PKCS #11 compliant HSM configuration to use for digital signatures.

    Only required if the identity specified in *identity* was enrolled using an HSM.

    | **Type**: dict

    pkcs11library
      The PKCS #11 library that should be used for digital signatures.

      | **Type**: str

    label
      The HSM label that should be used for digital signatures.

      | **Type**: str

    pin
      The HSM pin that should be used for digital signatures.

      | **Type**: str


  path (required)
    The path to the file where the channel genesis block is stored.

    | **Type**: str
