=========================================================================================

.. contents::

   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

Add, update, and remove consortium members for a Hyperledger Fabric ordering service by using the IBM Blockchain Platform.

This module works with the IBM Blockchain Platform managed service running in IBM Cloud, or the IBM Blockchain Platform software running in a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.






Parameters
----------

  api_endpoint (optional, str, None)
    The URL for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_authtype (optional, str, None)
    ``ibmcloud`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using IBM Cloud authentication. You must provide a valid API key using *api_key*.

    ``basic`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using basic authentication. You must provide both a valid API key using *api_key* and API secret using *api_secret*.


  api_key (optional, str, None)
    The API key for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_secret (optional, str, None)
    The API secret for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``basic``.


  api_timeout (optional, integer, 60)
    The timeout, in seconds, to use when interacting with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_token_endpoint (optional, str, https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token)
    The IBM Cloud IAM token endpoint to use when using IBM Cloud authentication.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``ibmcloud``, and you are using IBM internal staging servers for testing.


  state (optional, str, present)
    ``absent`` - An organization matching the specified name will be removed from the consortium.

    ``present`` - Asserts that an organization matching the specified name and configuration exists in the consortium. If no organization matches the specified name, the organization will be added to the consortium. If an organization matches the specified name but the configuration does not match, then the organization in the consortium will be updated.


  path (optional, str, None)
    Path to current the system channel configuration file.

    This file can be fetched by using the :ref:`channel_config <channel_config_module>` module.

    This file will be updated in place. You will need to keep a copy of the original file for computing the configuration update.


  organization (optional, raw, None)
    The organization to add, update, or remove from the consortium.

    You can pass a string, which is the display name of an organization registered with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    You can also pass a dictionary, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`organization_info <organization_info_module>` or :ref:`organization[] <organization[]_module>` modules.
