Synopsis
--------

Fetch and update the configuration for a Hyperledger Fabric channel by using the IBM Blockchain Platform.

This module works with the IBM Blockchain Platform managed service running in IBM Cloud, or the IBM Blockchain Platform software running in a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.






Parameters
----------

  api_endpoint (required)
    The URL for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_authtype (required)
    ``ibmcloud`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using IBM Cloud authentication. You must provide a valid API key using *api_key*.

    ``basic`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using basic authentication. You must provide both a valid API key using *api_key* and API secret using *api_secret*.

    | **Type**: str

  api_key (required)
    The API key for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_secret
    The API secret for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``basic``.

    | **Type**: str

  api_timeout
    The timeout, in seconds, to use when interacting with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: int
    | **Default value**: ``60``

  api_token_endpoint
    The IBM Cloud IAM token endpoint to use when using IBM Cloud authentication.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``ibmcloud``, and you are using IBM internal staging servers for testing.

    | **Type**: str
    | **Default value**: ``https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token``

  operation (required)
    ``create`` - Create a channel configuration update transaction for a new channel.

    ``fetch`` - Fetch the current channel configuration to the specified *path*.

    ``compute_update`` - Compute a channel configuration update transaction using the original configuration at *origin* and the updated configuration at *updated*.

    ``sign_update`` - Sign a channel configuration update transaction.

    ``apply_update`` - Apply a channel configuration update transaction.

    | **Type**: str

  ordering_service
    The ordering service to use to manage the channel.

    You can pass a string, which is the cluster name of a ordering service registered with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    You can also pass a list, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`ordering_service_info <ordering_service_info_module>` or :ref:`ordering_service <ordering_service_module>` modules.

    Only required when *operation* is ``fetch`` or ``apply_update``.

    Cannot be specified with *ordering_service_nodes*.

    | **Type**: raw

  ordering_service_nodes

    You can also pass a dict, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`ordering_service_node_info <ordering_service_node_info_module>` or :ref:`ordering_service_node <ordering_service_node_module>` modules.

    Only required when *operation* is ``fetch`` or ``apply_update``.

    Cannot be specified with *ordering_service*.

    If specified when *operation* is ``create``, then the specified ordering service nodes are used as the consenters for the channel. This is useful when you want to use a subset of nodes in an ordering service; for example, when you only want to use three ordering service nodes from a five node ordering service.

    | **Type**: raw

  identity
    The identity to use when interacting with the ordering service or for signing channel configuration update transactions.

    You can pass a string, which is the path to the JSON file where the enrolled identity is stored.

    | **Type**: raw

  msp_id
    The MSP ID to use for interacting with the ordering service or for signing channel configuration update transactions.

    Only required when *operation* is ``fetch``, ``sign``, or ``apply_update``.

    | **Type**: str

  hsm
    The PKCS #11 compliant HSM configuration to use for digital signatures.
