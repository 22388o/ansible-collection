Synopsis
--------

Get information about a Hyperledger Fabric certificate authority by using the IBM Blockchain Platform.

This module works with the IBM Blockchain Platform managed service running in IBM Cloud, or the IBM Blockchain Platform software running in a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.






Parameters
----------

  api_endpoint (optional, str, None)
    The URL for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_authtype (optional, str, None)
    ``ibmcloud`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using IBM Cloud authentication. You must provide a valid API key using *api_key*.

    ``basic`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using basic authentication. You must provide both a valid API key using *api_key* and API secret using *api_secret*.


  api_key (optional, str, None)
    The API key for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_secret (optional, str, None)
    The API secret for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``basic``.


  api_timeout (optional, integer, 60)
    The timeout, in seconds, to use when interacting with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.


  api_token_endpoint (optional, str, https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token)
    The IBM Cloud IAM token endpoint to use when using IBM Cloud authentication.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``ibmcloud``, and you are using IBM internal staging servers for testing.


  name (optional, any, None)
    The name of the certificate authority.


  wait_timeout (optional, integer, 60)
    The timeout, in seconds, to wait until the certificate authority is available.









Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    



Return Values
-------------

  exists (, boolean, )
    True if the certificate authority exists, false otherwise.


  certificate_authority (, dict, )
    The certificate authority.


    name (, str, )
      The name of the certificate authority.


    api_url (, str, )
      The URL for the API of the certificate authority.


    operations_url (, str, )
      The URL for the operations service of the certificate authority.


    ca_url (, str, )
      The URL for the API of the certificate authority.


    ca_name (, str, )
      The certificate authority name to use for enrollment requests.


    tlsca_name (, str, )
      The certificate authority name to use for TLS enrollment requests.


    location (, str, )
      The location of the certificate authority.


    pem (, str, )
      The TLS certificate chain for the certificate authority.

      The TLS certificate chain is returned as a base64 encoded PEM.


    tls_cert (, str, )
